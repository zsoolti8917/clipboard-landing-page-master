## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Generally i learned utility classes and how to use them but i am not sure if i used them correctly applying to classes? i would love feedback on that.
I learned how to change the color of an svg if it is in a img tag, i played a lot around it and in the end opted to use filters on it. I know that it is not the best approach but i dont like it when the svg is used inline in the HTML.
Learned a cool hover effect on buttons, I love it and will definitely use it more.
I tried to make it as responsive as i could and i think i did a good job overall, hovewer i think i should have used clamps for the font sizes? right now i have 2 fixed sets which i change with media query.

### Continued development

I don't plan to come back to this project in the near future. Maybe when i learn react will redo it but it is the song of the future.
