### What I learned

This was a really fun project! It was pretty easy and a good one to practice using the grid. However, I have one major issue: on the phone, there is no space under the last container. If I add margin, it does not help, and I don't know why it could be like this. Any help would be appreciated.

Also, I became a Pro member, so this was my first-ever project where I used Figma. I have to say, it is neat! It is so much easier that I don't need to think about whether 2 headers are the same size or not. I am very happy with it. In the end, I tried to play a little with animations and learned that it is not as easy as I thought. I added the sliding animation to the card, and this way, I could not add hover animations to it, which is pretty disappointing. I tried for at least an hour to make it work, but I could not, and I want to move on with the projects. Maybe later, I will come back to it.

From the responsive side, it should be totally responsive. I followed the mobile-first approach, which I love.

Also, in this project, I tried to add utility classes, but I have no idea if I did it right or wrong or when to apply the utility class to a header or element, etc. Any feedback regarding this would be appreciated.

### Continued development

Maybe later, I will come back to it.
